"These hour-long sessions are organised by the Instructor Development "
"Committee and serve a number of purposes. Trainee Instructors use them as"
" part of their checkout process. There they can raise questions about "
"teaching workshops and other matters and get advice from more experienced"
" Instructors. All sessions are run by volunteers. Instructors preparing "
"to teach can attend to ask questions, get tips, and find useful examples "
"or analogies they can use. Instructors who have recently taught can "
"attend to debrief about what went well, and what might have gone better, "
"so they can plan for next time. Sessions are coordinated through this "
"etherpad."

"Mentoring is a professional development opportunity that the Carpentries "
"offers our growing Instructor pool to help community members learn and "
"grow. Whether you are a new Instructor preparing to teach your first "
"workshop, a seasoned Instructor hoping to run workshops in a new "
"community, or an Instructor excited about getting involved with lesson "
"development and maintenance, mentoring groups will help you gain the "
"confidence, technical skills, and teaching skills you need to reach your "
"goal. Mentoring groups run in specified rounds at regular intervals. See "
"the Mentoring Groups section for more information."

"Software Carpentry (SWC), Data Carpentry (DC), and Library Carpentry (LC)"
" are programs of The Carpentries (a fiscally sponsored project of "
"Community Initiatives). All programs offer two day long workshops taught "
"live in-person by a team of two trained instructors. Software Carpentry "
"focuses on best practices in computational programming that help "
"scientists and researchers be more effective with their work. Lessons are"
" domain agnostic and use generic data. All Software Carpentry workshops "
"always cover three core areas: shell scripting (bash), version control "
"(Git), and a programming language (R or Python). Read more here (https"
"://software-carpentry.org/lessons/). Data Carpentry has a similar "
"foundation but focuses on the data lifecycle, from cleaning & "
"organization to analysis & visualization. Lessons and the data they use "
"are domain specific, with offerings in ecology/biology, genomics, "
"geospatial data, and more in the works. Read more here "
"(http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/ ). Library Carpentry workshops "
"teach people working in library- and information-related roles how to "
"apply concepts from software development fields in library tasks and "
"identify and use best practices in data structures."
